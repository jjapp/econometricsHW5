\section{Question 1. Discrete Choice (44 points):}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run a clogit of transportation choice on travel time (10 points)
\item What percentage of people in the data choose each of the four options? (10 points)
\item What are the predicted probabilities with the clogit? (10 points)
\item Suppose that planes get quicker, and that the average plane trip becomes one
hour shorter. (12 points)
\begin{enumerate}
\item How much less likely (as a percent) are people to fly? (3 points)
\item How much more likely (as a percent) are people to take the train? (3 points)
\item How much more likely (as a percent) are people to take the bus? (3 points)
\item How much more likely (as a percent) are people to take a car? (3 points)
\end{enumerate}
\item Report the marginal effect of travel time on the likelihood that someone flies for someone making $20,000 a year and for someone making $80,000 a year. (12 points)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Question 2. Time Series: }

For this question you will need to clean some data. Take the
ur.dta dataset and merge it with the GDP cleaned.dta file so that you have
data on the average unemployment rate in a quarter and quarterly GDP
growth. Keep data from 1950 to present that you can match (i.e. you can’t
use October 2017). You will want to use the commands “collapse” and
“merge” here. With this cleaned data, answer the following questions (34
points)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using only data from 1950 through 2016, test for stationarity in both variables. Ignore drifts and trends. (24 points)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you are asked to regress UR on GDP growth. In order for this regression to be meaningful, what needs to be true? (4 points)
\item Is UR stationary? (3 points)
\item If not, how many lags do you need to include for it to become stationary? (3 points)
\item Is GDP growth stationary? (3 points)
\item If not, how many lags do you need to include for it to become stationary? (3 points)
\item Can you run a meaningful regression of UR and GDP given what you have found above and any other evidence you may want to explore? If not, run a model with transformations of the variables that would be meaningful. (8 points)
\end{enumerate}
\item Run a VAR of UR on GDP growth.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Try this with 1-5 lags. Pick the best model according to the BIC and report only those results. (10 points)
\item Does GDP growth Granger cause UR? (5 points)
\item Does UR Granger cause GDP growth? (5 points)
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
